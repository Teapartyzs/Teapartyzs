### Hi there 👋

### I'm Raka, a Mobile Developer who loves Kotlin and Flutter 🚀 🧑‍💻.

I'm all about creating cool, functional mobile apps — whether it’s native Android with Kotlin or building cross-platform magic with Flutter. I love diving into clean code, smooth UX, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in mobile development.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech, experimenting with app ideas, or geeking out over the next big thing in mobile dev. Always down for a good challenge and open to collaborating on fun projects! (Well maybe play some video games, mostly 👌)

Let’s create something awesome together! 😎
